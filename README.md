# packing

## Getting started
I've developed with bun:

1. Install [bun](https://bun.sh/)
2. `bun install` - Install deps
3. `bun run dev` - Start dev server

But npm seems to work as well:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

## The project

### Decisions
- I normally try to stay away from classes in otherwise functional react projects but decided to use classes for game objects in this case.
I felt that modelling in games fit oop fairly well in the sense that entities have state that you then want to affect in different ways.
The alternative as I saw it was to use a bunch of utils-function that took `Board`- and `Tile`-objects and that feels a bit too decoupled.
- Board != BoardEntity - I decided to suffix the game object with "Entity" to distinguish from the React components with the same name.
- I have used vanilla css and leveraging CSS modules and CSS variables. Modern css is really plenty, especially since nesting was introduced [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/?search=css-nesting). I feel that tools like styled components obfuscates which parts of the JSX contains "actual" components with logic as opposed to information about styling. Using css-classes separates styling from logic and in vy view reduces overhead.
- I have added a "Fuska" button that sets the board so that its one step away from completion. It was useful when testing the
CelebrationOverlay and `isSolved`-method. I kept it in because it might be nice when reviewing.
- It would be nice to highlight all tiles set to be moved when hovering over one, this would require quite a bit more logic and
a departure from the simple ":hover" though

### Further development
- It would be nice to animate the movements. It's probably difficult to do with the current grid layout. I'd wager that you
would have to position the tiles absolutely and grab the x, y coordinates from each tile instance.
- You could store a hash of the puzzle state in the url and update it after every move. That would enable the user share state with others.

| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| board     | The game board holding all tiles                                                                        |

| entity    | Suffix added to distinguish between the object holding game logic and rendering (Board vs. BoardEntity) |


### About
- Runtime is [bun](https://bun.sh/)
- Uses vite
- Uses [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) for fast Refresh


### Tests
Tests are co-located with the files that are tested and have the suffix `.test.`
